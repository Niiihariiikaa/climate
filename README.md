This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

=======
PROPOSED machine
This preferred model ambitions to forecast the maximum appropriate crop for specific terrains by way of thinking about various elements and damage prediction. It'll collect statistics from numerous assets, which include government websites..
 
Data preparation (This involves cleansing the statistics, handling missing values, dividing the data into education, and checking out sets)
ML Model FOR YIELD AND RAINFALL PREDICTION(This version will make use of Random Forest Classifier algorithm)
FOR CROP damage (This version will estimate the quantity of crop damage based totally on more than one factor)
EXPERIMENTAL outcomes
We examined the version with diverse information units and the results are almost accurate.
The findings display that the Random wooded area Classifier is successful in forecasting crop damage with a high diploma of precision.
